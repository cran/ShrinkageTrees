Description: Bayesian regression tree ensembles for survival analysis and causal
 inference. Implements BART, DART, Bayesian Causal 
  Forests (BCF), and Horseshoe Forests models.
  Supports right-censored survival outcomes 
  via accelerated failure time (AFT) formulations. Designed for 
  high-dimensional prediction and heterogeneous treatment effect 
  estimation in causal inference.
